# This project was created for learning purposes only, If you wich to contribute you are welcome. 

## Requirements 

This app is using django as backend and django-channels and ajax for front-end for real time communications wich is a good approach without any 3rd parties applications like pusher. 

- For the forms i did include bootstrap but it was modified with a custom css file under the name "style.css".
- For the real time notification in this app an old websocket script was deployed in the front-end, however in the back-end django-channels is working side by side with django-signals and redis server. The reason why i use an old websocket script from django-channels early release is for simplicity as this app get better and better the script will be remover and replaced with a better solution like sockets
- For the chat system websockets was used as front-end receiver and django-channels as the back-end engine.
